    "## Data set:\n",
    "In the early hours of April 15, 1912, the RMS Titanic, a luxurious ocean liner hailed as \"unsinkable,\" met a tragic fate in the icy waters of the North Atlantic. On its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City, the ship collided with an iceberg, tearing open its hull and sealing the fate of over 1,500 passengers and crew.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite being equipped with advanced safety features, including watertight compartments and wireless telegraphy, the Titanic's catastrophic sinking shocked the world and sparked sweeping reforms in maritime safety standards. This iconic disaster serves as a stark reminder of the frailty of human endeavors in the face of nature's unyielding force.\n",
